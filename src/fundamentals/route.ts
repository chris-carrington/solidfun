   * - IF `this.b4()` return is truthy => returned value is sent to the client & `this.component()` is not called
   * - It is not recomended to do db calls in `this.b4()`
   * - Recomended options include:
   *     - Read request event 
   *     - Append values to request
   *     - Do a redirect
   *     - Append values to response
   *     - Append values `event.locals`
   * - From an auth perspective, `this.b4()` is a great spot to do a 1st session data check, so `getSessionData()` and append it to`event.locals`. & then  `this.component()` is a great spot to do a 2nd more thorough session data check w/ db calls. This process is similair to the 2 steps movie theater ticket verification process
   * - ‚ú® Note: If returning from `b4`, that response must be a `Response` object. So if a redirect is desired use [Response.redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/redirect_static) or the Solid's `redirect()` which does that for us or the Solid Fun's `go()` which calls `redirect()` and provides intellisense!
   * - üö® Important note: If calling `go()` in `b4()` add a return type of `GoResponse` to `b4()`. `go()` requires knowledge of all routes, so calling `go()` in a route will cause a ts recursion loop w/o the return type, example:
        ```ts
        import { go } from '@solidfun/go'
        import { Route } from '@solidfun/route'
        import type { GoResponse } from '@solidfun/types'


        export default new Route({
          path: '/',
          async b4(): GoResponse {
            return go('/test')
          }
        })
        ```
